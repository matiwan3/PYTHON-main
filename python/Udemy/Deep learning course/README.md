<b>Plan of Attack</b>
What we will learn in this section:
- The neuron
- The activation Function
- How do Neural Networks work? (example)
- How do neural Networks learn?
- Gradient Descent

8. The Neuron
- Dendrites (Receiver of the signal)
- Axon (transmitter of the signal)
- Neuron

signal is passed through synapses to neuron and then we have output value
Input layer: independent variables

9. The Activation Function
a. Threshold function (yes or no)
b. Sigmoid function
