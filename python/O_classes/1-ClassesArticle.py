# Python Class Methods: Class Vs. Instance Vs. Static Methods

# In this article we are going to look at methods that we can use in Python classes. 
# Methods are essentially functions within a class. 
# In Python, we can use three (3) different methods in our classes: 
# class methods, 
# instance methods, 
# and static methods. 
# We are going to look at how each method differs from the other. 
# Before we dive into the methods, let's look at two types of attributes that we find in classes. 
# Understanding class attributes is crucial to understanding methods.

# Class Attributes
# What is a class attribute? A class attribute is a variable that belongs to a class. 
# It is a property of the class. It belongs to the class rather than any specific object. 
# This attribute is created outside of the constructor method (__init__). 
# Below, we have a code that demonstrates how we create class attributes in a class.
