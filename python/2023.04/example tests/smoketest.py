#     This example smoke test defines a test case called TestSmoke and two test methods: test_file_exists and test_function_returns_true.

# The test_file_exists method opens a file called example_file.txt and reads its contents. It then uses the assertTrue method to check that the contents are not empty.

# The test_function_returns_true method calls a function called example_function and uses the assertTrue method to check that the function returns True.

# The example_function is a simple function that just returns True.

# Finally, the if __name__ == '__main__': statement runs the tests using the unittest.main() method.

# This smoke test is a simple example, but you can add more test cases and test methods to cover more scenarios in your application. The idea of a smoke test is to quickly check that the basic functionality of your application is working correctly, before moving on to more comprehensive tests.
