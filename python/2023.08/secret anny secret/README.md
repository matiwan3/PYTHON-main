What is this project about?

1. depp AI face/person generator using python. Below steps that needs to be covered to create such model:
    - Data Collection: You'll need a large dataset of faces or people images to train your AI model. You can use public datasets like CelebA, LFW, or collect your own data.
    - Data Preprocessing: Prepare your data by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset (if needed) to increase its size and diversity.
    - Deep Learning Model: You'll need to choose a deep learning model architecture for generating faces. Popular choices include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
    Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
    - Library Choice: Some popular libraries that can help you with creating AI face/person generators include:
       a. TensorFlow: An open-source deep learning library developed by Google.
       b.PyTorch: An open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook.
       c. Keras: A high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow or other backends.
       d. DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) or ProGAN (Progressive GAN) implementations can be good starting points for GAN-based face generation.
       e. Training: Train your model on the prepared dataset. This step can be computationally expensive and might require a powerful GPU.
    - Evaluation: Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), or Perceptual Path Length (PPL).
    - Generation: Use the trained model to generate new faces or people images by sampling from the learned distribution.
