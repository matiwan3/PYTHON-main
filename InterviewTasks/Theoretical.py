# 1. What is Python?
# Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language. It uses English keywords frequently. Whereas, other languages use punctuation, Python has fewer syntactic constructions.
# Python is designed to be highly readable and compatible with different platforms such as Mac, Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.

# 2. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
# Lists =[ Lists are mutable, i.e., they can be edited, Lists are usually slower than tuples, Lists consume a lot of memory, Lists are less reliable in terms of errors as unexpected changes are more likely to occur, Lists consist of many built-in functions, Syntax:list_1 = [10, ‘Intellipaat’, 20]]
# Tuples = (Tuples are immutable (they are lists that cannot be edited), Tuples are faster than lists, Tuples consume less memory when compared to lists, Tuples are more reliable as it is hard for any unexpected change to occur, Tuples do not consist of any built-in functions, Syntax:tup_1 = (10, ‘Intellipaat’ , 20))

# 3. What is pep 8?
# PEP in Python stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a set of rules that specify how to write and design Python code for maximum readability.
